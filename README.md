# smart-parking-management
Smart Parking Lot system developed in C language to illustrate Operating System concepts such as deadlock, resource allocation, process control, and synchronization.

Smart Parking Lot — Operating Systems Project
A Smart Parking Lot simulation developed in C language to demonstrate core Operating Systems concepts such as deadlock, resource allocation, and process synchronization.
This project models parking slots as limited resources and vehicles as processes competing for those resources.

 *Project Overview
1.The Smart Parking Lot system simulates:
2.Limited parking resources
3.Multiple vehicles requesting parking slots
4.Resource allocation and release
5.Deadlock scenarios when resources are unavailable
6.The main goal is to understand how deadlocks occur and how resource management works in Operating Systems.

*Operating System Concepts Used
✔ Deadlock
✔ Resource Allocation
✔ Process Management
✔ Mutual Exclusion
✔ Synchronization
✔ Waiting Queue Concept

*Features
1.Smart parking slot simulation
2.Multiple vehicle requests
3.Resource allocation logic
4.Deadlock situation demonstration
5.Simple command-line interface
6.Easy-to-understand C implementation

*Technologies Used
1.C Programming Language
2.Standard C Libraries
3.Operating Systems Concepts
